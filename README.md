hello all! My name is Mason and I am in business information technology. I currently work full time, while going to school, starting a business, being a dad and being a husband. I have a daughter that is 2, and my wife Laci and I have been married for almsot 6 years. I enjoy working with my hands, binge watching shows, watching basketball, going to concerts and mostly spending time with my family.
